# React Hooks Implementation
## [Live Demo](https://react-hooks-acv.vercel.app/)

Welcome to the React Hooks implementation repository! Here, you can explore various React hooks and see how they work in different scenarios.

## Hooks

### 1. [useState](https://github.com/arjuncvinod/React-hooks/blob/master/src/useState/UseState.jsx)
`useState` is a hook that allows functional components to manage local state. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it, enabling you to create dynamic and interactive UIs.

### 2. [useEffect](https://github.com/arjuncvinod/React-hooks/blob/master/src/useEffect/UseEffect.jsx)
`useEffect` is used for side effects in functional components. It lets you perform tasks like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in a clean and efficient way.

### 3. [useRef](https://github.com/arjuncvinod/React-hooks/blob/master/src/useRef/UseRef.jsx)
`useRef` returns a mutable object called a `ref` object, which has a `.current` property. It is commonly used to access and interact with the DOM directly or to persist values across renders without causing re-renders.

### 4. [useReducer](https://github.com/arjuncvinod/React-hooks/blob/master/src/useReducer/UseReducer.jsx)
`useReducer` is a powerful alternative to `useState` for managing more complex state logic. It accepts a reducer function and an initial state, providing a dispatch function to update the state based on actions.

### 5. [useLayoutEffect](https://github.com/arjuncvinod/React-hooks/blob/master/src/useLayoutEffect/UseLayoutEffect.jsx)
`useLayoutEffect` is similar to `useEffect` but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. It's useful when you need to perform measurements or manipulate the DOM immediately after the browser paints.

### 6. [useImperativeHandle](https://github.com/arjuncvinod/React-hooks/tree/master/src/useImperativeHandle/UseImperativeHandle.jsx)
`useImperativeHandle` customizes the instance value that is exposed when using `React.forwardRef`. It allows you to control which properties of the component are exposed to the parent component when using `ref`.

### 7. [useContext](https://github.com/arjuncvinod/React-hooks/tree/master/src/useContext/UseContext.jsx)
`useContext` is used to consume values from a React context. It allows functional components to subscribe to a context's changes, providing a more straightforward way to share values like themes or authentication states.

### 8. [useMemo](https://github.com/arjuncvinod/React-hooks/tree/master/src/useMemo/UseMemo.jsx)
`useMemo` memoizes the result of a function, preventing unnecessary recalculations. It is beneficial for optimizing performance by caching expensive calculations or references.

### 9. [useCallback](https://github.com/arjuncvinod/React-hooks/tree/master/src/useCallback/UseCallback.jsx)
`useCallback` memoizes a callback function, preventing it from being recreated on each render. It is useful when passing callbacks to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
